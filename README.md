   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install bless blessed arabic-reshaper python-bidi
   ```
4. Run the GUI receiver (recommended for Glass/Screens):
   ```bash
   sudo ./venv/bin/python gui_receiver.py
   ```
   Or the terminal receiver:
   ```bash
   sudo ./venv/bin/python receiver.py
   ```

#### Remote Control:
Use the **Home** screen sliders to adjust:
- **Font Size:** Dynamically scales text on the receiver.
